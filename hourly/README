* Operating environment
The scripts here have some HPC module dependencies:

    - wget   (should be in base login env)
    - lftp   (should be in base login env)
    - NCO    (NCO/4.9.7-foss-2020b/ used for testing)
    - netCDF (netCDF/4.7.4-gompi-2020b used for testing)

* Earthdata login
*NOTE* One must have a valid NASA Earthdata login set up in a valid
~/.netrc file in order for this script to access data.

* Usage
  - Build a day of MERRA2 hourly (takes ~10 minutes)
    ./merra2_hourly_buildDay.sh YYYY MM DD

    - needs ~1.5GB diskspace 

  - Build a month of MERRA2 hourly (takes ~6hrs)
    ./merra2_hourly_buildMonth.sh YYYY MM

    - needs ~42GB diskspace

  - Build a year of MERRA2 hourly (probably takes ~3 days)
    ./merra2_hourly_buildYear.sh YYYY

    - needs ~540GB diskspace

  - Rebuild entire archive (probably takes ~2 months)
    for year in {2002..2024}; do
      ./merra2_hourly_buildYear.sh $year
    done
    ./merra2_hourly_buildMonth.sh 2025 01

    - needs ~12TB diskspace

  - *NOTE* building a month or a year /could/ be parallelized on
    either strowinteract or HPC (Part odf the rationale for the
    modular design...) for time savings.

* NOTE
The hourly download scripts have been updated to match the style of
the more often used monthly scripts BUT they have not been updated to
include the longwave variables recently added to the monthly archive
and future pulls. The current scripts match ASL variable content in
ECMWF/ERA. Should one wish to build out a MERRA2 hourly archive which
includes longwave variables, one must figure out what variables are
available in the hourly archive (probably same/similar as in the
monthly), what MERRA2 products they come from (may or may not be
hourly equivalent to thhose used in monthly), and modify the
downloadFile and repackage scripts to support their collection. Which
brings us to:

* NOTE OF SOME IMPORTANCE
Should one want to add new variables to the archive:
 - if the new variables come from one of these MERRA2 datasets:
    - M2I3NVASM
    - M2I3NVAER
    - M2I3NVCHM
    - M2I1NXASM
    - M2T1NXRAD
    - M2T1NXFLX

   one must modify the repackage_merra2_hourly_* scripts described below
   to add support for the new variables

 - if the new variables come from datasets NOT in the above list,
   support will need to be added to the download_merra2_hourly_*.sh,
   merra2_hourly_downloadFile.sh, and repackage_merra2_hourly_*.sh
   scripts

* ANOTHER NOTE OF SOME IMPORTANCE
Because of the use of netcdf compression on the final files placed in
the archive, it is problematic to write a utility to add additional
variables to the existing archive. If one wants to add variables to
the archive, it is simpler to edit the relevant scripts to support the
new variables and then rebuild the entire archive as illustrated in
"Usage" above.

* merra2_hourly_downloadFile.sh 
The download workhorse. This and the two repackage_* routines are the
main routines for merra2 hourly production. Everything else is pretty
much wrapper functions.

merra2_hourly_downloadFile.sh -{L/S} "merrakey" YEAR MONTH
     -L signifies levels download where "merrakey" is one of {asm,cld}
     -S signifies surface download where "merrakey" is one of {asm,rad,flx}

If new variables are desired that require bringing down files not in
that set, this routine will need to modified to add options for them.

* repackage_merra2_hourly_*.sh
Once MERRA2 files are in-hand, the variables required need to be
extracted, renamed, stuffed into a new, single output file and
compressed. That is done in these routines. Like downloadFile above,
if new variables are added to the archive, these routines need to be
modified to deal with them.

These routines require the NCO module be loaded on the cluster for
access to ncks and ncrename and the netCDF module be loaded for nccopy

* Archive structure
THe MERRA2 hourly archive is based in the HPC filesystem at
/asl/model/merra2 (physically based
/umbc/xfs3/strow/asl/merra2/).

Currently, the archive enjoys a continguous existence on xfs3. Should
that need to change for future space considerations, my suggestion
(echoing Howard's suggestions) is to break the archive down on year
boundaries and symlink in other disk systems using a duplicate path
structure.

In other words: suppose one needs to move some merra2_hourly data to
isilon for space reasons. Let's say one wants to move 2024, 2025, and
the INCOMING directories from xfs3 to isilon. Build a tree on isilon
that duplicates the /asl/models/merra2 tree to store the
directories to move

i.e. /umbc/isilon/rs/strow/asl/models/merra2/{2024,2025,INCOMING}

NOTE: this may be partly mkdir and partly mv-ing directories already
containing data

Symlink these directories back into
/asl/models/merra2/{2024,2025,INCOMING}

and go about your day.

The download script keys off the /asl/models/merra2/{YYYY,
INCOMING} paths and does not require editing if the symlinks elsewhere
in the system point to this tree.
